Suggestions to Further Secure the Documents on CloudFront
Use Signed URLs or Signed Cookies for CloudFront:

Implement signed URLs or cookies in CloudFront to restrict access to authorized users and requests.
The API can generate these signed URLs/cookies with a short expiration time and provide them to the frontend, ensuring that only valid users can download the documents.
Restrict CloudFront Access to Specific Origin(s):

Configure an origin access identity (OAI) in CloudFront to ensure that only your API servers can retrieve content from the CloudFront distribution.
This prevents unauthorized access to the documents via CloudFront directly.
Add Authentication and Authorization:

Enforce strong authentication at the API level (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can request documents.
Validate the user's permissions before generating a signed URL or retrieving a document.
Use Encrypted Storage and Transit:

Ensure that the documents are encrypted both at rest (e.g., using S3 bucket encryption) and in transit (e.g., using HTTPS).
Monitor and Log Access:

Use CloudFront and API logs to monitor document access patterns. Identify and block any suspicious activities.
Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection:

Implement rate limiting at the API level to prevent abuse.
Use AWS Shield or WAF to protect the CloudFront distribution from DDoS attacks.
Expire and Revalidate Document Access:

Consider implementing a mechanism where the API verifies document access rights on each request, ensuring that users cannot reuse signed URLs indefinitely.
Front-End Best Practices:

Minimize exposure of sensitive data (e.g., encrypted document IDs) in the frontend by obfuscating or adding an additional layer of authorization.
